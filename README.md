## Releasing

Releases are handled automatically by [auto](https://github.com/intuit/auto). By setting the correct labels on a pull request, the semantic versioning is handled automatically, GitHub releases are generated as well as a changelog.

Once a pull request has been merged to `main` it is automatically released as the `latest` version.
